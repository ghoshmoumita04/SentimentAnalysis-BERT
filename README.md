# SentimentAnalysis-BERT
Sentiment analysis model using BERT

This project implements a hybrid sentiment analysis system that combines:

A pre-trained transformer model (DistilBERT – SST-2) for sentence-level sentiment analysis

Rule-based negative trigger detection for professional and explicit negative feedback

Constructive criticism detection to differentiate between purely negative and improvement-oriented feedback

The goal is to provide more realistic and context-aware sentiment classification, especially for corporate, academic, and performance review–style text, where feedback is often nuanced rather than strictly positive or negative.
